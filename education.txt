Hello World

In this file, i'm going to express my thoughts about some topics related to education.


TOPIC #1 -> Education in Latin America

In Latin America, education is one of the biggest challenges we face for decades. There
are several reasons for the lack of development in this topic: Political, historical,
cultural, etc. And the consequences of this involution affects us considerably every day:
Lack of economic development, consistent poverty, poor social development, reduced
quality of life, propensity of social conflicts, democracy weakness, between others.
