Hello World.

In this file, i'm going to express some thoughts about education-related topics.


TOPIC #1 -> Education in Latin America

In Latin America, education is one of the biggest challenges we face for decades. There
are several reasons for the lack of development in this topic: Political, historical,
cultural, etc. And the consequences of this involution affects us considerably every day:
Lack of economic development, consistent poverty, poor social development, reduced
quality of life, propensity of social conflicts, democracy weakness, between others.

Despite the fact that we are in the 21st century and technological innovations are
constantly improving all the aspects of our lives, in the context of education, the 
education model in the region is still obsolete. Therefore, millions of latin americans
are suffering a digital gap that will grow each year due to poor pedagogical approaches in
the education system, lack of public policies from the government, low eagerness for knowledge,
between other reasons.
