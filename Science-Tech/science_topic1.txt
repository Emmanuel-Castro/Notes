Hello World.

In this file, I'm going to create short paragraphs about physics-related topics.


TOPIC #1 -> Importance of Science Communication.

Science has made important contributions to humankind. Thanks to science,
our society experienced innovations that improved our lives exponentially.

Based on that premise, the importance of the diffusion of science communication 
is more important in an era that massive disinformation, the spread of ignorance, 
extreme polarization and many other issues are the daily bread of millions of people
around the world.

The rise of STEM disciplines makes more relevant the need to invest in a science-based
education for governments to stay in the vanguard of our digital era.
