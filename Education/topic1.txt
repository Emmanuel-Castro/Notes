TOPIC #1 -> Financial Education in Latin America

One of the main challenges is the lack of formal educational programs that address financial literacy 
from an early age. Although some countries have begun to include financial content in their school curricula, 
implementation is uneven and often superficial. Furthermore, adults often learn about finances experientially, 
which can perpetuate unhealthy habits such as over-indebtedness or a lack of savings.

Financial education initiatives typically come from banks, NGOs, and multilateral organizations, which offer 
workshops, digital platforms, and awareness campaigns. However, these initiatives do not always reach the most 
vulnerable communities, especially in rural areas or those with low connectivity. Lack of trust in financial 
institutions also hinders the adoption of good practices.

Moving forward requires a more inclusive and contextualized approach that combines digital tools with participatory 
methodologies. Financial education must be adapted to the cultural and economic realities of each country, promoting 
economic empowerment as a way to reduce poverty and foster financial resilience.
