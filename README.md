# Notes Repository


The purpose of this repository is to improve documentation and writing skills.

The content consists of in simple plain text files with some information on it.


Here are the main skills I want to improve with this simple repository: 

- **Git**: Version control software to manage repo versions. I want to master this technology 
to improve my teamwork skills. Collaboration is key in software development. 

- **Communication**: This is the most important soft skill for software developers. 
Written communication is just as important as verbal. So, in this case, I want to learn 
to communicate in an effective way through writing. 

- **Tech Writing**: For me, to understand the fundamentals of this skill will have an impact 
on my work. Through constant practice, I may be able to express technical concepts in 
a simple way.
